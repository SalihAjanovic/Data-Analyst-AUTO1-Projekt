## üìö Key Insights & Visuals

### üìä **1. Actual vs. Estimated Travel Time by Route Type (Pivot Table)**
![Actual vs Estimated Travel Time](https://imgur.com/uBTH2mm.png)

**Summary:**
- **FTL routes** have significantly higher travel times than **Carting routes**.
- On average, actual travel times are **longer than OSRM-estimated times** across all route types.
- **FTL deliveries take nearly twice the estimated time**, indicating potential inefficiencies or traffic constraints.

### üìä **2. Top 10 Destination Hubs by Shipment Volume (Pivot Table)**
![Top 10 Destination Hubs](https://imgur.com/NAmCea7.png)

**Summary:**
- The top **10 hubs** handle the highest shipment volumes.
- **Gurgaon_Bilaspur_HB (Haryana)** is the busiest hub with **15,000+ shipments**, followed by **Bangalore_Nelmngla_H (Karnataka)** with **11,000+ shipments**.
- These high-traffic hubs are critical for **logistics efficiency and resource optimization**.

---

### üìä **3. Average Delay Factor by Route Type (Pivot Table)**
![Average Delay Factor](https://imgur.com/637PmLb.png)

**Summary:**
- **Carting routes have a higher average delay factor (2.4) compared to FTL (2.0)**.
- This suggests **Carting routes may face more operational delays**.
- FTL, despite having longer actual times, is relatively more predictable in delays.

### üìä **4. Delivery Hotspots: Heatmap of Travel Times (Looker Studio)**
![Delivery Hotspots](https://i.imgur.com/XFg3doS.png)

**Summary:**
- A **heatmap visualization** in Looker Studio identifies key delivery hotspots across India.
- **High-density areas** indicate major logistics hubs with **longer travel times**.
- A **route filter** allows differentiation between **FTL and Carting deliveries**.

---

### üìä **5. Route Efficiency & Delay Analysis (Looker Studio)**
![Route Efficiency & Delay](https://i.imgur.com/HxJxXNP.png)

**Summary:**
- **FTL routes consistently exceed OSRM travel estimates**, indicating inefficiencies.
- A **scatter plot** of actual distances vs. delay factors reveals clustering around **1.6‚Äì2.2 delay factor**, suggesting **consistent delays** across certain distances.
