## üìö Key Insights & Visuals

### üìä **1. Actual vs. Estimated Travel Time by Route Type**
![Actual vs Estimated Travel Time](https://yourimagehosting.com/image1.png)

**Summary:**
- **FTL routes** have significantly higher travel times than **Carting routes**.
- On average, actual travel times are **longer than OSRM-estimated times** across all route types.
- **FTL deliveries take nearly twice the estimated time**, indicating potential inefficiencies or traffic constraints.

### üìä **2. Top 10 Destination Hubs by Shipment Volume**
![Top 10 Destination Hubs](https://yourimagehosting.com/image2.png)

**Summary:**
- The top **10 hubs** handle the highest shipment volumes.
- **Gurgaon_Bilaspur_HB (Haryana)** is the busiest hub with **15,000+ shipments**, followed by **Bangalore_Nelmngla_H (Karnataka)** with **11,000+ shipments**.
- These high-traffic hubs are critical for **logistics efficiency and resource optimization**.

---

### üìä **3. Average Delay Factor by Route Type**
![Average Delay Factor](https://yourimagehosting.com/image3.png)

**Summary:**
- **Carting routes have a higher average delay factor (2.4) compared to FTL (2.0)**.
- This suggests **Carting routes may face more operational delays**.
- FTL, despite having longer actual times, is relatively more predictable in delays.
