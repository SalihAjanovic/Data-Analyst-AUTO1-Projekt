    - Apply transformations for analysis in pivot tables.

2. **Analysis & Insights:**  
    - SQL queries for metric calculations.  
    - Python (pandas, matplotlib) for data exploration.  
    - Pivot tables in Excel for deeper insights.  

3. **Dashboard Development:**  
    - Create an interactive dashboard in Looker Studio.  
    - Include filters for transport type, route, and time period.
