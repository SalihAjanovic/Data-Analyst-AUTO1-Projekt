- **Size:** 144,867 records  
- **Structure:**  
    - **`data`**: Identifies whether the data is for training or testing  
    - **`trip_creation_time`**: Timestamp when the trip was created  
    - **`route_schedule_uuid`**: Unique ID for route scheduling  
    - **`route_type`**: Transport type (e.g., FTL)  
    - **`trip_uuid`**: Unique ID for each trip  
    - **`source_center`**: Code for the source logistics center  
    - **`source_name`**: Name of the source logistics center  
    - **`destination_center`**: Code for the destination logistics center  
    - **`destination_name`**: Name of the destination logistics center  
    - **`od_start_time`**: Start time of the trip  
    - **`od_end_time`**: End time of the trip  
    - **`start_scan_to_end_scan`**: Duration from the start to the end scan *(numeric, with values ranging from 20 to 7898)*  
    - **`is_cutoff`**: Indicator for cutoff occurrence *(True/False)*  
    - **`cutoff_factor`**: Factor associated with cutoff *(mean: 232.93, max: 1927)*  
    - **`cutoff_timestamp`**: Timestamp of the cutoff event  
    - **`actual_distance_to_destination`**: Measured distance to the destination *(mean: 234.07, max: 1927.45)*  
    - **`actual_time`**: Actual trip duration *(mean: 416.93, max: 4532)*  
    - **`osrm_time`**: Estimated time from OSRM *(mean: 213.87, max: 1686)*  
    - **`osrm_distance`**: Estimated distance from OSRM *(mean: 284.77, max: 2326.19)*  
    - **`factor`**: Ratio of actual to estimated time *(mean: 2.12, max: 77.39)*  
    - **`segment_actual_time`**: Actual time for a trip segment *(mean: 36.19, max: 3051)*  
    - **`segment_osrm_time`**: Estimated time for a trip segment *(mean: 18.50, max: 1611)*  
    - **`segment_osrm_distance`**: Estimated distance for a trip segment *(mean: 22.83, max: 2191.40)*

    - **`trip_duration`**: Total trip time in hours.  
    - **`efficiency_score`**: Distance covered per hour.  
    - **`time_variance`**: Difference between actual & estimated delivery time.  
    - **`delay_factor`**: Ratio of actual time to estimated time.  
    - **`route_category`**: Categorized as **Long-haul vs. Short-haul**.  

## üìö Key Insights
- **Average trip duration:** ~16 hours.
- **Efficiency score:** ~0.54 (distance covered per hour).
- **Delay factor:** Deliveries take **twice as long as estimated**.
- **Routes with highest delays:** Carting routes have **more delays** than FTL.
- **Busiest hubs:** Certain logistics centers handle **significantly more shipments**, requiring optimized resource allocation.
